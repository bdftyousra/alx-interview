# Island Perimeter

This project contains interview coding challenges.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Island Perimeter**<br/>[0-island_perimeter.py](0-island_perimeter.py) contains a module with a function having the prototype `function def island_perimeter(grid):`, which returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`, with the following requirements:
  + `grid` is a list of list of integers:
    + 0 represents water.
    + 1 represents land.
    + Each cell is square, with a side length of 1.
    + Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    + `grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100.
  + The grid is completely surrounded by water.
  + There is only one island (or nothing).
  + The island doesn't have "lakes' (water inside that isn't connected to the water surrounding the island).
