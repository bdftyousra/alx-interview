# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project contains interview coding challenges.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Rotate 2D Matrix**<br/>[0-rotate_2d_matrix.py](0-rotate_2d_matrix.py) contains a module with a function that rotates an `n` x `n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise with the following requirements:
  + Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`.
  + Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
  + You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
